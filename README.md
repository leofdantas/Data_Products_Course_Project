# Data_Products_Course_Project
Final project for the Data Products course from the John Hopkins University Data Science Specialization on Coursera

The project was based on the creation of a Shiny Web Page (uploaded to shinyapps.io)

The scripts used for such are ui.R and server.R

A set of slides, Data_Products_Course_Project_Slides.html, is included to argue why the ShinyApp is an effective tool to show patterns in the dataset at hand
